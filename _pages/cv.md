Research experience
======
**Scattering Transform Pipeline on Cosmological Constraints**
* November, 2023 - present: Master thesis
  * University Observatory Munich
  * Utilized Morlet wavelet filters of varying scales and orientations to perform wavelet convolution on cosmological convergence square maps. Calculated the modulus of the convolved fields and used the scattering coefficients (mean value of the convolved map) to quantify the field’s fluctuations.
  * Applied Fisher Forecast analysis to derive cosmological constraints based on the scattering coefficients, providing insights into the relationship between field fluctuations and cosmological parameters.
  * Developed neural network-based emulators trained on cosmological simulations to predict scattering coefficients for different cosmologies. Used these emulators to perform MCMC sampling and obtain posterior distributions, thereby deriving precise cosmological constraints.
  * Implemented the emulators trained in different tomographic bins to conduct a tomographic analysis and ran MCMC again to obtain refined cosmological constraints across on cosmological parameters.
  * Supervisors: [Dr.Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/~stella/stella.html) & Laurence(Zhengyangguang) Gong

**Time-dependent Kinetic Analysis of Positron-Hydrogen Collision Process**
* December, 2021 - May, 2022: Bachelor thesis
  * Jilin University
  * Investigated the scattering problem of positron and hydrogen through time-dependent wave function evolution for both particles. Applied the five-point formula to obtain the hydrogen atom’s ground state wave function and expressed the system’s Hamiltonian on a position grid.
  * Used five-point formula to express kinetic energy term and got the Hydrogen atom ground state wave function
  * Expressed the Hamiltonian of Hydrogen and positron in momentum space
  * Brought the initial wave function of the whole positron and hydrogen into evolution function, used split operator to evolve and got final wave function
  * Supervisor: [Prof.Liguang Jiao](https://teachers.jlu.edu.cn/lgjiao)

 **Influence of Target Membrane Material on Neutron Tube and Its Service Life**
* May, 2020 - October, 2020: Research intern
  * Jilin University
  * Explored the influence of the target membrane material and its surface layer Deuterium-Tritium on the neutron yield and the service life of the neutron tube
  * Mixed rare earth elements which can improve the alloy properties and possess good hydrogen storage effect into the titanium membrane material, used SRIM to figure out energy loss, calculated the neutron yield, compared with the performance of scandium, and found the most suitable doping metal
  * Got the conclusion that the neutron yield of lutetium-titanium alloy is the highest when the doping mass ratio is 0.2
  * Supervisor: Prof.Jingbin Lu

**Materials Physics and Battery**
* October, 2019 - January, 2020: Research intern
  * Jilin University
  * Prepared chlorophyll films of different thicknesses by the spin-coating method in a nitrogen environment, produced chlorophyll cells, and tested the conductivity of different film thicknesses
  * Analyzed the influence of rotation speeds on the chlorophyll film from collected data, and generalized the conductivity of the chlorophyll cell under different rotation speeds
  * Supervisor: Prof.Xiaofeng Wang


Course Project
======
**Gravitational Dynamics**
* July, 2023 - August, 2023 in Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München
  * Explored the possibility of capturing a meteorite at Lagrangian 4 Point of Sun: set the initial state of the particle so that it is just transported to the Lagrangian point so that it is in that position, rotating around the sun like Jupiter
  * Conclusion: circular motion is possible only when the minimum effective potential energy is equal to the total energy, which means there is no radial motion. A little deviation from that state will not lead to a perfect circular motion.


**Hydrodynamics**
* January, 2023 - February, 2023 in Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München
  * Nozzle Shape’s Influence on Acceleration: explore the influence of the shape of the nozzle throat on the effect of the nozzle, and the change of the speed of the particles before and after.
  * Conclusion: the shape of the obstacle in nozzle phenomena has little effects on the profile of velocity increase and internal energy, pressure and density distribution profile. But the width of the nozzle gap width will have visible effects on velocity acceleration. And if the gap is too narrow and the path is long, it will probably cause choking, which will not have nozzle acceleration effect


**Computational Physics**
* September, 2021 - November, 2021 in Jilin University
  * Derived the algebraic expression of the electromagnetic field excited by the magnetic dipole source in the homogeneous medium and the corresponding integral expression from Maxwell equations and Hertz formula
  * Used the cubic spline fitting integration method and Gauss-Legendre integration method separately and combined them to calculate the integral expression of the electric field and magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates with MATLAB
  * Compared the accuracy of the results of these three calculations with the results of algebraic calculations
