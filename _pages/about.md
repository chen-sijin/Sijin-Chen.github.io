Hello! I am a master student from [University Observatory Munich](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/index_en.php)(USM), [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html). I received my bachelor degree from Jilin University in 2022. My research interest includes cosmology, weak lensing, higher order statistics and machine learning. 

I am very fortunate to be supervised by Dr.Stella Seitz and Laurence(Zhengyangguang) Gong from USM & [Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main)(MPE) for my amster thesis, ***Scattering transform method on cosmological parameter constraint***. I was supervised by Prof.Liguang Jiao from physics department in Jilin University for the bachelor thesis about ***One Dimensional Positron-Hydrogen Scattering***.
