Hello! I am a master student from University Observatory Munich ([USM](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/index_en.php)) of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München ([LMU](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html)). I received my bachelor degree from Jilin University in 2022. My research interest includes cosmology, weak lensing, higher order statistics and machine learning. 

I am very fortunate to be supervised by Dr.Stella Seitz and Laurence(Zhengyangguang) Gong from USM & Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics ([MPE](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main)) for my master thesis, ***Scattering transform method on cosmological parameter constraint***. I was supervised by Prof.Liguang Jiao from physics department in Jilin University for the bachelor thesis about ***One Dimensional Positron-Hydrogen Scattering***. 

You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/chen-sijin/Sijin-Chen.github.io/blob/master/assets/CV_Sijin_Chen.pdf).
