Hello! I am a master student from University Observatory Munich ([USM](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/index_en.php)) of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München ([LMU](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html)). I received my bachelor degree from Jilin University in 2022. My research interest includes cosmology, weak lensing, parity violation, higher order statistics and machine learning. 

I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/~stella/stella.html) and [Zhengyangguanggong(Laurence) Gong](https://lgong6g.github.io/)  from USM & Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics ([MPE](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main)) in [OPINAS](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/opinas-en) group for my master thesis, ***Scattering transform method on cosmological parameter constraint***. I was supervised by Prof.Liguang Jiao from physics department in Jilin University for the bachelor thesis about ***One Dimensional Positron-Hydrogen Scattering***.
